With this application you will need just 5 minuts per day to dramatically expand your quick thinking capabilities. Game offers you 4 levels of difficulties (easy, medium, hard, extreme), so game can be helpful for everyone - from slow-thinkers to math geeks. Just remember. Math is the same as running, or yoga, or baseball. First day is hard, but no matter how old you are, every time you work with it you'll get more comfortable. Over time you can become a master of any study with just a bit of hard work and patience every day.",
